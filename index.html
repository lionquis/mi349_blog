    <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 09/23/2025</h3>

    <h4>The Beginning</h4>
    <p> Today I woke up at around <strong> 10AM </strong>, after spending a long day yesterday working at with the Learning Development Team and later spending time at home doing nothing productive. I woke up and showered, but by the time my first class was about to start, an intense storm started. Although I love the ambience and find it relaxing, it isn't ideal when you need to get to class without getting struck by lightning. </p>

    <h3>MI349</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, the storm passed, and I was able to make it to my next class. As I wrote this, I was currently in class for MI349, working on a <em>HTML coding assignment</em> intended to teach me some of the basic building blocks of this particular language. It was actually quite fun figuring out how everything worked.</p>

    <p>I needed to make a basic file, describing a day in my life - the one in which you are reading now, which included the following HTML elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>h1</li>
        <li>h2</li>
        <li>p</li>
        <li>header</li>
        <li>section</li>
        <li>ul</li>
        <li>ol</li>
        <li>li</li>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>em</li>
        <li>strong</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>After Class</h3>
    <p>After class, I biked home and relaxed for a little while at home - though not for long as I had some fun plans with a few friends that night. A week prior, one of my friends had a chance encounter with a poster advertising a weekly trivia night at the Jolly Pumpkin on Tuesdays, which sounded like a fun way to unwind, test my knowledge, and spend time with friends. We ended up getting last place - there were a lot of questions about movies which isn't really my area of expertise - but I didn't really care as I had a fun time regardless.</p>
