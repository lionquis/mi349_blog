    <h2>My Current Activities</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 09/25/2025</h3>
    <section>
    <h4>Academics</h4>
    <p> My schedule this semester has been unbelievably intense, as I have been scrambling to figure out what exactly I want my future to look like once I graduate from MSU - something which should happen in May 2026 unless something goes horrendously wrong. I am a part-time student, taking three classes, one representing each of my fields of study: MI349, representing information science, EC340 - a requirement for my international relations major, and HST212, representing my history minor. I enjoy MI349 and HST212, but EC340 is an absurdly difficult class - economics is not my strong suit. I am also considering applying to graduate school, as I am not confident about the job market, but I am unsure what exactly to specialize in. Hopefully I will figure that out soon.</p>

    <h4>Work</h4>
    <p> I currently work three jobs. The first, and most relevant job to my information science studies, is my job with the Learning Development Team at MSU, where I assist in creating educational materials and managing online resources. I also work as an event assistant at the MSU Horticulture Gardens, where I set up event spaces and assist with customer service. This job is seasonal; my last shift for the year will be this Saturday. I also work with the Visiting International Professional Program, in which I assist with a variety of university programs catered to international scholars and professionals. Over the summer, I worked with a group of German students, though in October I will work with a group of Korean professionals which may entail me going on work trips to both Northern Michigan and Chicago.</p>

    <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 09/23/2025</h3>

    <section>
    <h4>The Beginning</h4>
    <p> Today I woke up at around <strong> 10AM </strong>, after spending a long day yesterday working at with the Learning Development Team and later spending time at home doing nothing productive. I woke up and showered, but by the time my first class was about to start, an intense storm started. Although I love the ambience and find it relaxing, it isn't ideal when you need to get to class without getting struck by lightning. </p>

    <h3>MI349</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, the storm passed, and I was able to make it to my next class. As I wrote this, I was currently in class for MI349, working on a <em>HTML coding assignment</em> intended to teach me some of the basic building blocks of this particular language. It was actually quite fun figuring out how everything worked.</p>

    <p>I needed to make a basic file, describing a day in my life - the one in which you are reading now, which included several HTML elements. Here is a table describing the elements which I was required to utilize in this file.</p>

    <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Function</th>
        <th>Fact</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>h1</td>
        <td>Defines the main heading of a page.</td>
        <td>Best practices require the use of just one H1 heading per page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>h2</td>
        <td>Defines a secondary heading of a page.</td>
        <td>It is often used to begin a hierarchy of headings.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>p</td>
        <td>Defines a paragraph.</td>
        <td>An essential tool in making pages readable and visually appealing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>header</td>
        <td>Defines a header for a document or section.</td>
        <td>Typically contains introductory content or navigation links.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>section</td>
        <td>Defines a section in a document.</td>
        <td>Is often used to group related content together.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>ul</td>
        <td>Defines an unordered list.</td>
        <td>In HTML, unordered lists utilize bullet points.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>ol</td>
        <td>Defines an ordered list.</td>
        <td>In HTML, ordered lists utilize numbers or letters.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>Defines a hyperlink.</td>
        <td>These are a necessary tool in building coherent websites with several pages.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>em</td>
        <td>Italicizes text.</td>
        <td>This is a very useful tool in placing <em>emphasis</em> on something.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>strong</td>
        <td>Boldfaces text.</td>
        <td>This is a very useful tool in placing a <strong>strong</strong> emphasis on something.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>After Class</h3>
    <p>After class, I biked home and relaxed for a little while at home - though not for long as I had some fun plans with a few friends that night. A week prior, one of my friends had a chance encounter with a poster advertising a weekly trivia night at the Jolly Pumpkin on Tuesdays, which sounded like a fun way to unwind, test my knowledge, and spend time with friends. We ended up getting last place - there were a lot of questions about movies which isn't really my area of expertise - but I didn't really care as I had a fun time regardless.</p>
