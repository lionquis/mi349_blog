    <h2 class="alt">Work Trips</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 10/10/2025</h3>
    <section>
    <p> The time has come for me to create something using Flexbox, given the theme of me writing about random things of relevance related to my own life, I figure I might as well write about my upcoming work trips, as they are something I am both excited and nervous about - though mostly excited. I am going to be traveling a lot over the next few weeks, as several weeks ago my supervisors at my job with the Visiting International Professional Program reached out to me requesting my assistance for programs they are hosting for Korean professionals and masters students from Nanjing University in China. Below I will describe a few of the locations I am visiting and how I feel about the upcoming trips there</p>
    <div class="container">
        <aside class="side_bar">
            <h2>Ann Arbor</h2>
            <p>On Sunday the 19th, I will be visiting Ann Arbor, the last of a busy week of trips with the Nanjing University program. I have very conflicted feelings about this trip. On one hand, I am intimiately familiar with Ann Arbor, given that I am originally from Ypsilanti - making me the perfect tour guide of the area, as I visited the city very often during my childhood, and still do when I visit with my friends who still live in the area. On the other hand, it is absurdly inconvenient, as this trip happens to fall during MSU's fall break, which is effectively going to be cut short for me by the program. The part that bothers me the most is that I would have needed to go to the area that day anyways, as I have to return home to Ypsilanti as I have an optometrist appointment in the neighboring small town of Milan on Sunday morning. As I'll be driving a MSU vehicle, I'll have to drive to Ann Arbor, spend several hours there, and then back to MSU just to pick up my own car and drive to Ypsilanti. It will be very tedious but I'll have to make do with it.</p>

            <h2>Traverse City</h2>
            <p>As I am writing this, it is currently 11PM, and I am both working on updating this blog and preparing for my trip to Traverse City, which I will be leaving for tomorrow morning at 9:15. I am not yet sure whether or not I will be able to finish this particular assignment before I go to bed, but it will not be a huge issue for me as I will likely have plenty of time to finish this in my hotel room in Traverse City tomorrow night. I am quite excited for this trip, as I have not been to Traverse City in quite a long time - I would say I travel around Michigan quite frequently, but Traverse City has always been out of reach for me as I've never had a good reason to go there until now. I think the last time I went there was over a decade ago, as I remember a few times when I was young my parents would take my sister and I to the Great Wolf Lodge, a themed hotel with a large water park inside of it. I hear it is a beautiful area, so I am excited to go back, and I'm sure that the autumn scenery will be especially beautiful in northern Michigan this time of year. I do not know a lot about what there is to see up there, but fortunately today I received some good suggestions (if you're reading this, thank you). During the structured part of my time there, I'll have time to tour the Old Village as well as downtown Traverse City, in addition to going to a vineyard (I won't be tasting any as I'll be driving), the Mission Peninsula, and Sleeping Bear Dunes. I'll probably have a little bit of time to explore on my own, but the itinerary has been crafted to ensure that I'll be constantly busy. Interestingly, I will also be going to Traverse City again next weekend, that time with the Nanjing University students whereas this week I'll be going with the Korean program. That will only be a day trip, but it seems that over the coming weeks I'll be getting to know Traverse City extremely well despite my relative unfamiliarity with the area. As it is both the trip that I will be embarking on the soonest as well as the only destination that I'll be visiting twice, I have a lot of thoughts about visiting Traverse City, hence why I somewhat arbitrarily assigned it the largest and most prominent box. </p>

            <h2>Chicago</h2>
            <p>Two weekends from now, on the 25th and 26th, I will be visiting Chicago, once again with the Korean professional program. I am very excited for this trip, as it has been a very long time since I have visited that city - not as long ago as Traverse City, but I haven't been to the city since February 2020, in which I visited for a Model United Nations conference that I remember as being the last interesting thing I did before the world shut down because of the pandemic. I'm very excited to visit Chicago, though - I know less about my schedule, but I know I'll be doing some cool things, such as visiting Navy Pier, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Art Institute of Chicago. I expect this to be a very fun trip, but I am quite worried about driving in Chicago. I've never driven in a city that big before - the only truly large city I have driven in is Detroit.</p>

    <h2 class="alt">My Current Activities</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 09/25/2025</h3>
    <section>
    <h4>Learning Technology & Development</h4>
    <p> The majority of my effort professionally is directed to my position with the Learning Technology & Development team at the Broad College of Business, with whom I work on a variety of tasks involving the creation of educational materials and the maintenance of online resources. My work with them has ranged considerably, including a multitude of types of content creation - such as interactive modules for Broad classes, Vyond videos, and educational posters - as well as less creative work such as transcribing online lessons. The Learning Technology & Development team has ambitious goals, though - recently, plans to discuss an online gamified team project management platform have arisen, something which I have a strong interest in working on. Although this project is still only in its conceptual stages, hopefully work on it will begin next month.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h4>Arum</h4>
    <p> I have also been actively working to get more involved with UX projects outside of my work. Through connections at a student organization at MSU called Imagine Software, I was put in contact with a local start-up called Arum - which intends to create a website connecting interior designers and people who need help with interior design - where I am currently contributing to the design and development of their user interface. This project has only just started, with the initial introductory meeting happening just two weeks ago - though I am excited to see where it goes.</p>

    <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
    <h3>By Lance Lionquist - 09/23/2025</h3>

    <div class="float_right">
    <img class="storm" src="thunderstorm.jpg" alt="" width="100"height="100"><br>
    <span> A storm much stronger than the one I encountered today.</span>
    </div>

    <section>
    <h4>The Beginning</h4>
    <p> Today I woke up at around 10AM, after spending a long day yesterday working at with the Learning Development Team and later spending time at home doing nothing productive. I woke up and showered, but by the time my first class was about to start, an intense storm started. Although I love the ambience and find it relaxing, it isn't ideal when you need to get to class without getting struck by lightning. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>MI349</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, the storm passed, and I was able to make it to my next class. As I wrote this, I was currently in class for MI349, working on a <em>HTML coding assignment</em> intended to teach me some of the basic building blocks of this particular language. It was actually quite fun figuring out how everything worked.</p>

    <p>I needed to make a basic file, describing a day in my life - the one in which you are reading now, which included several HTML elements. Here is a table describing the elements which I was required to utilize in this file.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>After Class</h3>
    <p>After class, I biked home and relaxed for a little while at home - though not for long as I had some fun plans with a few friends that night. A week prior, one of my friends had a chance encounter with a poster advertising a weekly trivia night at the Jolly Pumpkin on Tuesdays, which sounded like a fun way to unwind, test my knowledge, and spend time with friends. We ended up getting last place - there were a lot of questions about movies which isn't really my area of expertise - but I didn't really care as I had a fun time regardless.</p>
