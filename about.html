    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <section>
    <p>My name is Lance Lionquist, and I am currently a fifth-year super senior at Michigan State University, studying a variety of wildly different subjects, including two majors (international relations and information science) and a minor - history. I am currently in the process of trying to figure out what exact direction I want to take my life in once I graduate, and as such have been exploring a variety of options, opportunities, and different fields of interest. Originally interested in the social sciences, I have found myself increasingly drawn to digital technology, both due to a genuine interest in learning more about the field and a desire to pivot to an area with stronger work opportunities. Initially being interested in UX design and the more creative aspect of digital media, I have since become more interested in the more technical, markup-oriented aspects of the field, which in a way almost reminds me of an old passion from when I was in high school - modding video games. Regardless, I hope to continue learning and growing in these areas - I have already found multiple opportunities to do so, but hope to find even more in the near future.</p>

    <p> My schedule this semester has been unbelievably intense, as I have been scrambling to figure out what exactly I want my future to look like once I graduate from MSU - something which should happen in May 2026 unless something goes horrendously wrong. I am a part-time student, taking three classes, one representing each of my fields of study: MI349, representing information science, EC340 - a requirement for my international relations major, and HST212, representing my history minor. I enjoy MI349 and HST212, but EC340 is an absurdly difficult class - economics is not my strong suit. I am also considering applying to graduate school, as I am not confident about the job market, but I am unsure what exactly to specialize in. I hope I will figure this out in more depth soon, but in the meantime I have already found a variety of graduate school programs in a range of countries which interest me - potentially fulfilling both my desire to further integrate myself into this field and my interest in international experiences. Some of the universities I am most interested in include the following:</p>

    <section>
    <p> I currently work three jobs. The first, and most relevant job to my information science studies, is my job with the Learning Development Team at MSU, where I assist in creating educational materials and managing online resources. I also work as an event assistant at the MSU Horticulture Gardens, where I set up event spaces and assist with customer service. This job is seasonal; my last shift for the year will be this Saturday. I also work with the Visiting International Professional Program, in which I assist with a variety of university programs catered to international scholars and professionals. Over the summer, I worked with a group of German students, though in October I will work with a group of Korean professionals which may entail me going on work trips to both Northern Michigan and Chicago.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging with a wide variety of hobbies, though lately I have not had a lot of time to engage with them as I have found myself needing to balance my academic commitments, my three part-time jobs, my social life, and research regarding the direction in which I should take my life after I graduate. During less busy times, I like to keep myself occupied in a variety of ways, though - the weather is nice, I enjoy biking - it is a great source of exercise, and I always enjoy being able to see more of the local area. The Lansing area in particular is a wonderful place to go biking, with the River Trail offering a lot of great views. I also have a range of creative interests, including writing and photography - and when I was younger I also taught myself coding through video game modding, as was previously mentioned. In addition to these, I also have strong interests - both academic and personal - in history, geography, and international relations, and one of my greatest passions of all, above anything else mentioned here, is travel.</p>
